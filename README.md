# Rock Paper Scissors Game

## Setup

1. Start a new Git repo for your project.
2. Create a blank HTML document with a script tag (Hint: it is best practice to link an external .js file). This game is going to be played completely from the console, so donâ€™t worry about putting anything else in there.

## Functions

### 1. getComputerChoice

- Description: Generates a random choice ('Rock', 'Paper', or 'Scissors') for the computer.
- Usage: This function will be used to determine the computer's play in the game.

### 2. playRound(playerSelection, computerSelection)

- Description: Plays a single round of Rock Paper Scissors.
- Parameters:
  - `playerSelection`: The choice made by the player.
  - `computerSelection`: The choice generated by the computer.
- Returns: A string declaring the winner or tie of the round.
- Note: The `playerSelection` parameter is case-insensitive.

### 3. playGame()

- Description: Plays a five-round game of Rock Paper Scissors, keeping score and reporting a winner at the end.
- Usage: Call this function to play the game.
- Note: Uses the `playRound()` function internally.
- Additional Instructions:
  - Use `console.log()` to display the results of each round and the winner at the end.

  - Feel free to create more helper functions if needed.
